** Design
*** Usage
**** Client creates the =RocksDB= instance, passes to index functions
**** All operations must go through index functions (put, delete, etc)
**** Register view definitions to provide index keys and values
**** Query on the index with or without keys for filtering the results
**** Functions to build the index as needed, such as for existing data
*** Data Model
**** Database keys and values are defined by the application
***** i.e. library does not dictate any particular format or key prefix
**** Indices are named (e.g. "etags") by the application
**** Index key consists of a prefix from the app plus a unique suffix
***** Because the app may output non-unique values, the key must be made unique
***** Suffix needs to be sufficiently unique even if many records are written in a short time
**** App outputs additional data as the value for the index row
***** Application provides a mapping function to provide index keys and values
***** In addition to the key, the mapping function also emits other data
***** A single invocation of the mapping function may emit multiple rows of data
**** Specifying a ~reduce~ function means index rows consist of key and value is reduce output
***** e.g. ~count~ would result in key from map output and value from reduce output
***** e.g. [('foo', 12), ('bar', 4), ('quux', 101)]
**** Indices must be namespaced to avoid collision with application data
***** RocksDB supports column families for this purpose
**** Querying index employs the RocksDB key prefix iterator
***** Consequently the query operation returns an iterator
***** Results returned are the data from the mapping function
***** RocksDB can quickly scan to a key prefix to start iterating
**** When querying mulitple keys, results are returned in the given key order
*** References
**** https://misfra.me/2017/01/18/how-to-implement-secondary-indexes/
***** index key is the information you're searching for, value is the original key
***** important to keep the keys unique and canonically formed
**** RocksDB FAQ seems to suggest using column families for different "key spaces"
***** c.f. https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Column-Families
** Implementation
*** Indices are stored in separate column families
**** Name consists of our special prefix (e.g. =mrview=) and the index name
**** Each registered index has an associated column family handle
*** Row deletions must update the appropriate index!
*** API Details
**** Create index
***** operation should be idempotent
**** Delete index
***** remove the registered view functions
***** remove the corresponding column family
**** List indices
**** Query index
***** returns an iterator to return the results as needed
***** results are the output from the app mapping function
***** rows are returned in the same order as the supplied keys array
***** optional keys value to set start/end of results range
***** optional number of rows to skip
***** optional number of rows to limit
**** Build index
***** As a means of constructing the index with existing data
***** Maybe the data was modified externally, for example
**** Index cleanup
***** Called by the application in an ad hoc fashion
***** Delete any column families with our prefix that do not match any registered view
*** Development
**** DONE Consider how =delete= will update the indices
***** investigate how PouchDB deals with this
****** this could be what PouchDB refers to as ~stale~ results
****** how to detect stale results?
****** are stale results returned in the scan?
***** how to implement record deletion
****** on =delete()= save the primary key in the ~mrview--deleted~ cf
****** maintain a bloom filter of deleted primary keys
****** on startup, scan ~mrview--deleted~ to get prime the bloom filter
****** on =query()=, find and remove stale entries for all views, clear deleted rows
****** on =put()= check if key was in deleted set, if so remove ~mrview--deleted~ row
**** DONE Query an index with a single key
***** returns only results whose key matches the filter
**** DONE Replace all key and value args from =&[u8]= to generic types that implement =AsRef<[u8]>=
**** TODO Query an index with multiple keys
***** returns only results whose key matches each of the keys
***** results returned in the same order as the keys
**** TODO Remove stale index entries on =delete()=
**** TODO Clean up stale indices
**** TODO Consider options for thread safe operations
*** Publishing
**** TODO Write a guide on how to use properly
***** Define views at time of DB open
***** Prime the indices at startup to improve response time
**** TODO Start a changelog
**** TODO Write API documentation at the module level
***** assumes we already wrote function-level documentation
**** TODO Write a quick example for the =README.md=
**** TODO Write a simple example crate in =examples= directory
**** DONE Populate =Cargo.toml= with useful meta information
**** TODO Push to GitHub
**** TODO Publish to crates.io
*** Further Work
**** TODO Read the LSM key/value stores research paper on secondary index algorithms
***** Has various approaches to implementing indices
** Alternative Databases
*** [[https://github.com/spacejam/sled][sled]] is similar to RocksDB, written in Rust
**** would use their ~keyspace~ in place of column families
**** would use their ID generator in place of ULID or whatever
